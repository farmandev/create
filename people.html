                                                <p>Mitsu has been in the teaching profession for over twenty five years. She graduated with an honours degree from Miranda House College in 1982 and completed her teacher’s training from Department of Education, Delhi University the following year. She gained her Master’s degree from Agra University in 1998. She began her teaching career at Laxman Public School, Delhi when it was still a budding institution. A transfer to Jodhpur led her to St Anne’s School where the pedagogy was classical but was juxtaposed with the freedom to experiment. Army School Agra was the next challenge as the learners were first generation, straight out of their villages. Next came Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, which follows a child centric pedagogy with ABL and PBL. Her experience with ICSC came at Greenlawns School, Mumbai. The move back to Delhi in 2015 led to a shift in her career from school teaching to teacher support. With Learning Links Foundation she designed curriculum and content to support their efforts with government schools across the country. For a short period, she headed their intervention with a MCD school at Delhi. She then joined Universal Learn Today where she supported schools through direct intervention as well as teacher training workshops. Mitsu has always strived to challenge herself professionally as well as personally. She did a course with INTEL when computers were emerging as tools in the education space. She did a beginner’s course in French to experience functional learning of a foreign language. She applied this learning to her classrooms with excellent results. </p>

                                                    Mitsu has been in the teaching profession for over twenty five years. She graduated with an honours degree from Miranda House College in 1982 and completed her teacher’s training from Department of Education, Delhi University the following year. She gained her Master’s degree from Agra University in 1998. She began her teaching career at Laxman Public School, Delhi when it was still a budding institution. A transfer to Jodhpur led her to St Anne’s School where the pedagogy was classical but was juxtaposed with the freedom to experiment. Army School Agra was the next challenge as the learners were first generation, straight out of their villages. Next came Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, which follows a child centric pedagogy with ABL and PBL. Her experience with ICSC came at Greenlawns School, Mumbai. The move back to Delhi in 2015 led to a shift in her career from school teaching to teacher support. With Learning Links Foundation she designed curriculum and content to support their efforts with government schools across the country. For a short period, she headed their intervention with a MCD school at Delhi. She then joined Universal Learn Today where she supported schools through direct intervention as well as teacher training workshops. Mitsu has always strived to challenge herself professionally as well as personally. She did a course with INTEL when computers were emerging as tools in the education space. She did a beginner’s course in French to experience functional learning of a foreign language. She applied this learning to her classrooms with excellent results.
